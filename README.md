# CrossSocket

CrossSocket is a cross-platform networking library written in C++17. Supported sockets are WinSock (Windows) and POSIX Socks (Unix).

### Prerequisites

CrossSocket utilises either WinApi (for WinSock) or the Linux API (e.g "sys\socket.h" as a header). You must have at least one of these to use CrossSocket.
